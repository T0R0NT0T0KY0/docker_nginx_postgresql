Comments inside the Dockerfile explain what each step does:

Step 1: Use the official PostgreSQL image and set the environment variable with the password.
Step 2: Use the official Nginx image and copy the configuration file for Nginx.
Step 3: Use the official Node.js image, install dependencies, and copy the application. Application build starts.
Step 4: Use the Nginx image, merge the images from the previous steps, and start Nginx on port 80.
The assembled image can be called "bulatov_da_image_<current date>" using the command:

```perl
docker build -t bulatov_da_image_$(date +%Y-%m-%d) .
```

After running this command, the image will be created and you can start the container using the command:

```perl
docker run -p 80:80 bulatov_da_image_$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```
